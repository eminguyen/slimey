# Meet Slimey!
![slime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32719891/35777241-45572366-095f-11e8-9a65-3d2905b99130.gif)

This is Slimey! We created him at HackUCI.

Our original concept was to incorporate cookie clicker elements with a multiplayer battle / trade system.
He has a permanently increasing hunger bar that must be satisfied by feeding. If you satisfy his hunger completely,
he will level up and his attack and defense will increase by a random amount. 
We also used SendGrid's API to add the ability to send an email to yourself of the pet's statistics.

While we did get the base of a battle system implemented, we did not add it to the final application before
the deadline sadly. You can see that progress in our pet-test.js file.
