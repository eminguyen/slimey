## Meet Slimey!
![slime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32719891/35777241-45572366-095f-11e8-9a65-3d2905b99130.gif)

This is Slimey! We created him at HackUCI.

Our original concept was to incorporate cookie clicker elements with a multiplayer battle / trade system.
He has a permanently increasing hunger bar that must be satisfied by feeding. If you satisfy his hunger completely,
he will level up and his attack and defense will increase by a random amount. 
We also used SendGrid's API to add the ability to send an email to yourself of the pet's statistics.

While we did get the base of a battle system implemented, we did not add it to the final application before
the deadline sadly. You can see that progress in our pet-test.js file.

## How It Works
Feed Slimey to make him grow!

If hunger reaches 0, Slimey will level up and his stats will increase. When you are satisfied with your Slimey's growth, you have the option of receiving an email with your Slimey's stats.

Compete with your friends to see who can grow Slimey the most!
